Here we have compiled the list of frequently asked questions

**1) Why we don't provide trigger scale factors?**

Different analyses use diffrent trigger combinations as per requirements. On top that, even if two analyses use the same trigger, they may use different ID working points. It is difficult to provide scale factors for all the potential trigger+ID combinations. Therefore, we have decided not to provide a scale factor, but we will provide all the support to anyone who wants to measure the trigger scale factors for their analysis. Right from the tag-and-probe package to ntuples, we assist analyzers at each step. We maintain a list of the all the approved trigger scale factors here: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/EgHLTScaleFactorMeasurements
